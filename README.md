# TODO-TOP
Creating a todo list app for the odin project. Will help solidify concepts such as singular responsibility/oop and give more practice using the dom. Storing the information on the users computer so refreshing wont cause a wipe of the page will be a distant feature but it's on the list of things that need to be added to the application.
